// This file contains a copy of this recent addition to Rcpp just so that we do NOT
// have to enforce a dependency on this very recent Rcpp because of it. In "due
// course", maybe in a year or two, the definition of 'Nullable' below can be
// removed when a corresponding dependency on Rcpp (>= 0.12.1) is added.
//
// By keeing the same include guard, it is safe to have the file appear in both places
// in the meantime.
//
// The name of the file -- in the form PACKAGENAME_types.h -- is a convention used by
// Rcpp Attributes as we need the types defined here in the auto-generated interface.
