## We want C++11
CXX_STD = CXX11

## Header files from our package, RcppGSL comes in via LinkingTo: in DESCRIPTIPM
PKG_CPPFLAGS = -I. -I../inst/include

## If we want LTO (for testing or optimization)
#PKG_CXXFLAGS = -flto

## Use the R_HOME indirection to support installations of multiple R version
## And RcppGSL can tell us where GSL is installed so we get the libraries for linking
PKG_LIBS = `$(R_HOME)/bin/Rscript -e "RcppGSL:::LdFlags()"` -lpthread
