\details{ The \code{summary.manyglm} function returns a table summarising the 
statistical significance of each multivariate term specified in the fitted 
manyglm model (Warton 2011). For each model term, it returns a test 
statistic as determined by the argument \code{test}, and a P-value calculated 
by resampling rows of the data using a method determined by the argument 
\code{resamp}. Of the four possible resampling methods, three (case, residual 
permutation and parametric boostrap) are described in more detail in Davison 
and Hinkley (1997, chapter 6), but the default (PIT-trap) is a new method (in 
review) which bootstraps probability integral transform residuals, and which 
we have found to give the most reliable Type I error rates. All methods 
involve resampling under the alternative hypothesis. These methods ensure 
approximately valid inference even when the mean-variance relationship or the 
correlation between variables has been misspecified. Standardized pearson 
residuals (see \code{\link{manyglm}} are currently used in residual 
permutation, and where necessary, resampled response values are truncated so 
that they fall in the required range (e.g. counts cannot be negative). 
However, this can introduce bias, especially for \code{family=binomial}, so 
we advise extreme caution using \code{perm.resid} for presence/absence data. 
If \code{resamp="none"}, p-values cannot be calculated, however the test 
statistics are returned. 

If you have a specific hypothesis of primary interest that you want to test, then you should use the \code{\link[mvabund:anova.manyglm]{anova.manyglm}} function, which can resample rows of the data under the null hypothesis and so usually achieves a better approximation to the true significance level.

For information on the different types of data that can be modelled using manyglm, see \code{\link{manyglm}}. To check model assumptions, use \code{\link{plot.manyglm}}.

Multivariate test statistics are constructed using one of three methods: a log-likelihood ratio statistic \code{test="LR"}, for example as in Warton et. al. (2012), or a Wald statistic \code{test="wald"} or a Score statistic \code{test="score"}. "LR" has good properties, but is only available when \code{cor.type="I"}.
%Also recommended, but only for multi-sample testing, is a Wald statistic using the variance-stabilising link function (e.g. \code{family=negative.binomial(varstab)}), which has been shown to have good power properties (Warton 2008b). However use of this link function is only reasonable for multi-sample tests, a special case where changing link function can be considered as a reparameterisation of the model (rather than a change of model).

The default Wald test statistic makes use of a generalised estimating equations (GEE) approach, estimating the covariance matrix of parameter estimates using a sandwich-type estimator that assumes the mean-variance relationship in the data is correctly specified and that there is an unknown but constant correlation across all observations. Such assumptions allow the test statistic to account for correlation between variables but to do so in a more efficient way than traditional GEE sandwich estimators (Warton 2008a). The common correlation matrix is estimated from standardized Pearson residuals, and the method specified by \code{cor.type} is used to adjust for high dimensionality.

The Wald statistic has problems for count data and presence-absence 
data when there are estimated means at zero (which usually means very large parameter estimates, check for this using \code{coef}). In such instances Wald statistics should not be used, Score or LR should do the job. 

%By default, \code{summary.manyglm} tests hypotheses concerning mean (absolute) abundance, but it is also possible to test hypotheses concerning community composition using the argument \code{compositional=TRUE}, when analysing count data, as in Warton and Guttorp (2007). This constructs Wald statistics to test hypotheses concerning relative abundance not absolute abundance, and the parameters that are returned in the fitted model are for the relative change in abundance of one variable as compared to another (as compared to the last abundance variable in the mvabund array).

The \code{summary.manyglm} function is designed specifically for high-dimensional data (that, is when the number of variables p is not small compared to the number of observations N). In such instances a correlation matrix is computationally intensive to estimate and is numerically unstable, so by default the test statistic is calculated assuming independence of variables (\code{cor.type="I"}). Note however that the resampling scheme used ensures that the P-values are approximately correct even when the independence assumption is not satisfied. However if it is computationally feasible for your dataset, it is recommended that you use \code{cor.type="shrink"} to account for correlation between variables, or \code{cor.type="R"} when p is small. The \code{cor.type="R"} option uses the unstructured correlation matrix (only possible when N>p), such that the standard classical multivariate test statistics are obtained. Note however that such statistics are typically numerically unstable and have low power when p is not small compared to N. 

The \code{cor.type="shrink"} option applies ridge regularisation (Warton (2008b)), shrinking the sample correlation matrix towards the identity, which improves its stability when p is not small compared to N. This provides a compromise between \code{"R"} and \code{"I"}, allowing us to account for correlation between variables, while using a numerically stable test statistic that has good properties. 

The shrinkage parameter is an attribute of the \code{\link{manyglm}} object. For a Wald test, the sample correlation matrix of the alternative model is used to calculate the test statistics. So \code{object$shrink.param} is used. For a Score test, the sample correlation matrix of the null model is used to calculate the test statistics. So \code{shrink.param} of the null model is used instead. If \code{cor.type=="shrink"} but \code{object$shrink.param} is not available, for example \code{object$cor.type!="shrink"}, then the shrinkage parameter will be estimated by cross-validation using the multivariate normal likelihood function (see \code{\link{ridgeParamEst}} and (Warton 2008b)) in the summary test.

Rather than stopping after testing for multivariate effects, it is often of interest to find out which response variables express significant effects. Univariate statistics are required to answer this question, and these are reported if requested. Setting \code{p.uni="unadjusted"} returns resampling-based univariate P-values for all effects as well as the multivariate P-values, whereas \code{p.uni="adjusted"} returns adjusted P-values (that have been adjusted for multiple testing), calculated using a step-down resampling algorithm as in Westfall & Young (1993, Algorithm 2.8). This method provides strong control of family-wise error rates, and makes use of resampling (using the method controlled by \code{resamp}) to ensure inferences take into account correlation between variables.
