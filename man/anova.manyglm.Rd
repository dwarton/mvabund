\details{
The \code{anova.manyglm} function returns a table summarising the statistical significance of a fitted manyglm model (Warton 2011), or of the differences between several nested models. If one model is specified, sequential test statistics (and P values) are returned for that fit. If more than one object is specified, the table contains test statistics (and P values) comparing their fits, provided that the models are fitted to the same dataset.

The test statistics are determined by the argument \code{test}, and the 
P-values are calculated by resampling rows of the data using a method 
determined by the argument \code{resamp}. \code{resamp}. Two of the three 
available resampling methods (residual permutation and parametric bootstrap) 
are described in more detail in Davison and Hinkley (1997, chapter 6), 
whereas the default (the ``PIT-trap'', Warton et al 2017) 
bootstraps probability integral transform residuals, which we have found 
to give the most reliable Type I error rates. All methods involve resampling 
under the resampling under the null hypothesis. These methods ensure 
approximately valid inference even when the mean-variance relationship or the 
correlation between variables has been misspecified.  Standardized Pearson 
residuals (see \code{\link{manyglm}} are currently used in residual 
permutation, and where necessary, resampled response values are truncated so 
that they fall in the required range (e.g. counts cannot be negative). 
However, this can introduce bias, especially for \code{family=binomial}, so 
we advise extreme caution using \code{perm.resid} for presence/absence data. 
If \code{resamp="none"}, p-values cannot be calculated, however the test 
statistics are returned. 

If you do not have a specific hypothesis of primary interest that you want to test, and are instead interested in which model terms are statistically significant, then the \code{summary.manyglm} function is more appropriate. Whereas \code{summary.manyglm} tests the significance of each explanatory variable, \code{anova.manyglm}, given one \code{manyglm} object tests each  term of the formula, e.g. if the formula is 'y~a+b' then a and b, that can be vectors or matrices, are tested for significance.

For information on the different types of data that can be modelled using manyglm, see \code{\link{manyglm}}. To check model assumptions, use \code{\link{plot.manyglm}}.

Multivariate test statistics are constructed using one of three methods: a log-likelihood ratio statistic \code{test="LR"}, for example as in Warton et. al. (2012) or a Wald statistic \code{test="wald"} or a Score statistic \code{test="score"}. "LR" has good properties, but is only available when \code{cor.type="I"}. 
%Also recommended, but only for multi-sample testing, is a Wald statistic using the variance-stabilising link function (e.g. \code{family=negative.binomial(varstab)}), which has been shown to have good power properties (Warton 2008). However use of this link function is only reasonable for multi-sample tests, a special case where changing link function can be considered as a reparameterisation of the model (rather than a change of model). 

The default Wald test statistic makes use of a generalised estimating equations (GEE) approach, estimating the covariance matrix of parameter estimates using a sandwich-type estimator that assumes the mean-variance relationship in the data is correctly specified and that there is an unknown but constant correlation across all observations. Such assumptions allow the test statistic to account for correlation between variables but to do so in a more efficient way than traditional GEE sandwich estimators (Warton 2011). The common correlation matrix is estimated from standardized Pearson residuals, and the method specified by \code{cor.type} is used to adjust for high dimensionality. 

The Wald statistic has problems for count data and presence-absence 
data when there are estimated means at zero (which usually means very large parameter estimates, check for this using \code{coef}). In such instances Wald statistics should not be used, Score or LR should do the job. 

% By default, \code{anova.manyglm} tests hypotheses concerning mean (absolute) abundance, but it is also possible to test hypotheses concerning community composition using the argument \code{compositional=TRUE}, when analysing count data, as in Warton and Guttorp (2007). This constructs Wald statistics to test hypotheses concerning relative abundance not absolute abundance, and the parameters that are returned in the fitted model are for the relative change in abundance of one variable as compared to another (as compared to the last abundance variable in the mvabund array).

The \code{anova.manyglm} function is designed specifically for high-dimensional data (that, is when the number of variables p is not small compared to the number of observations N). In such instances a correlation matrix is computationally intensive to estimate and is numerically unstable, so by default the test statistic is calculated assuming independence of variables (\code{cor.type="I"}). Note however that the resampling scheme used ensures that the P-values are approximately correct even when the independence assumption is not satisfied. However if it is computationally feasible for your dataset, it is recommended that you use \code{cor.type="shrink"} to account for correlation between variables, or \code{cor.type="R"} when p is small. The \code{cor.type="R"} option uses the unstructured correlation matrix (only possible when N>p), such that the standard  classical multivariate test statistics are obtained. Note however that such statistics are typically numerically unstable and have low power when p is not small compared to N. 

The \code{cor.type="shrink"} option applies ridge regularisation (Warton 2008), shrinking the sample correlation matrix towards the identity, which improves its stability when p is not small compared to N. This provides a compromise between \code{"R"} and \code{"I"}, allowing us to account for correlation between variables, while using a numerically stable test statistic that has good properties. 

The shrinkage parameter is an attribute of a \code{\link{manyglm}} object. For a Wald test, the sample correlation matrix of the alternative model is used to calculate the test statistics. So \code{shrink.param} of the alternative model is used. For a score test, the sample correlation matrix of the null model is used to calculate the test statistics. So \code{shrink.param} of the null model is used instead. If \code{cor.type=="shrink"} and \code{shrink.param} is NULL, then the shrinkage parameter will be estimated by cross-validation using the multivariate normal likelihood function (see \code{\link{ridgeParamEst}} and (Warton 2008)) for the corresponding model in the anova test.

Rather than stopping after testing for multivariate effects, it is often of interest to find out which response variables express significant effects. Univariate statistics are required to answer this question, and these are reported if requested. Setting \code{p.uni="unadjusted"} returns resampling-based univariate P-values for all effects as well as the multivariate P-values, whereas \code{p.uni="adjusted"} returns adjusted P-values (that have been adjusted for multiple testing), calculated using a step-down resampling algorithm as in Westfall & Young (1993, Algorithm 2.8). This method provides strong control of family-wise error rates, and makes use of resampling (using the method controlled by \code{resamp}) to ensure inferences take into account correlation between variables. This functionality is not currently available for models of relative abundance via \code{composition=TRUE}.

\section{Warning}{
The comparison between two or more models by \code{anova.manyglm} will only be valid if they are fitted to the same dataset. This may be a problem if there are missing values and R's default of \code{na.action = na.omit} is used.
