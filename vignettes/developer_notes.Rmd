## Package structure
#### Where to find things

```
├── R # R code
├── data # Datasets
├── man # .Rd files
├── src # C++ and header files
├── tests # unit tests
└── vignettes # Vignettes
```
## C++
The main header file is called `resampTest.h`

This contains many `#define`'s and all of the class definitions.
We should consider refactoring this to give it a more logical structure.

### `glm`

`glm` is the base class and had PoissonGlm as its only subclass.
PoissonGlm has other families as is subclasses.
