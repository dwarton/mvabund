The goal of mvabund is to provide tools for a **model-based approach**
to the analysis of multivariate abundance data in ecology [(Yi Wang et
al. 2012)](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.2041-210X.2012.00190.x),
in particular, testing hypotheses about the community-environment
association. Abundance measures include counts, presence/absence data,
ordinal or biomass data.

This package includes functions for **visualising data, fitting
predictive models, checking model assumptions, as well as testing
hypotheses about the community–environment association**.

### Installation
